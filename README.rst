What is 'Novelist'
==================

Novelist is a skeleton of an application. The application would take directory, read all of its
contents (recursively), concatenate the files and write to a target.

Actually, `awendt/poet`_ does this and it's working quite well. However, I needed a small project to
play with some things in Haskell. This means e.g. Free Monads, CircleCI integration, hpack, etc.

In other words: do not expect to see this actually working in 100% as I don't need it to work 100%
